                Intemperelle is a platform that allows users to experience fashion shows from across the world. It generates a real-time experience with the option of viewing live 360. The fashion show also implements a feature that allows it to present the information of pieces on the model while they are walking down the runway. There are look-books and product section that allows brand followers to dive deeper into the pieces that caught their eyes in the show. The feature sections will keep consumers on the trends and offer them diverse collections to further personalize their style and interest.

                    This moodboard is constructed with elegant colors and unique compositions. The photos from the Iris Van Herpen and the Paris Fashion Week showcased both vibrant and earthy color palates. The fonts selected are versatile; they are high-quality, modern, and clean elegance. The layout will be simple, letting the content of the projects speak for itself. However, it plays with the sizing and movement of the text to showcase both volume and texture.

                My primary sketch on Intemperelle was creating a brand that focuses on live fashion shows with the ability to interact with the show and view what models are wearing in real-time. With the help of AI and VR headsets, the possibility for users to view and interact with the show allows more engagement than traditional shows in which the audience can only view but arenâ€™t certain of the pieces being presented with all the valued information that they are looking for. Having this in mind, I tried a more experimental design that allows creatives and those interested in this field to view an aesthetic that is more unique than that of the traditional layout of most websites.

                <p class="proj-content-text">
                The wireframing process for Intemperelle became a more refined version of my previous sketches. Continuing the idea of a more abstract versus traditional web layout, I tried incorporating a no-boundaries approach to the structure of the design. Having more free placement and an artistic view of what high fashion could look like, the design displays this by focusing on the use of negative space and placement of imagery over a heavy text-based website. This allows users to appreciate the design with their eyes instead of having to read to find the information that they seek.

                FINAL MOCKUP
            </h4>
            <p>
                In the final mockup, I tried to incorporate an artistic feel while highlighting new functions to fit the modern need of this brand. The color palette represents the sleek approach that is familiar with most high-fashion brands and the layout of the pages fits the aesthetic nature of this specific industry. I tried to use the power of imagery and placement in order for the website to speak for itself without the use of text to explain each part. The website is simple but impactful which allows the user to appreciate the focus point of this brand which is the design of the clothes themselves.
