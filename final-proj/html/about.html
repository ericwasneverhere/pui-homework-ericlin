                About Eric
            </h1>
            <p id="about-text">
                Eric is a UIUX designer studying Fine Arts & Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University.
            </p>
            <p>
                Growing up in Hong Kong, Eric has always been a creative individual. After moving to Los Angeles, he picked up sketching and painting. Later in high school, he expanded his range of media, learning digital design, photoshop, photography, and collage. Ericâ€™s inspirations are usually from the current state of society and the impact it has on him and his community. Aspiring to foster connections, he hopes his art can spark nuance and evoke creative visions in othersâ€“ or simply make their day a bit better.  
            </p>
            <p>
                At Carnegie Mellon University, Eric was exposed to design, especially design for user experience. He enjoys challenging his inventiveness by implementing artistic talent into his interest in technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Ericâ€™s leisure time, he can be spotted creating new music playlists (Japanese city pop and NewðŸ‘– jazz at the moment), swerving through traffic on his electric skateboard, staying active by hooping and gymming with friends, and devouring all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ.
